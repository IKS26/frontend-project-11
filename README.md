## Overview

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a format designed to describe news feeds, article announcements, and other online content. By subscribing to RSS feeds, users can receive updates from various websites in a single place, usually through a specialized service called an RSS reader or aggregator.

The **RSS-Reader** application allows users to aggregate multiple RSS feeds, making it easy to follow updates from blogs, news sites, and other sources in one place. With RSS-Reader, you can:

- Add an unlimited number of RSS feeds
- Get automatic updates with new posts added to the main feed
- Mark posts as read
- Preview posts in a modal window for quick reading

This application was developed as part of the Hexlet Frontend Development course.

## Interface Example

## Features

- **Unlimited Feeds**: Add as many RSS feeds as you want, and view all posts in a single timeline.
- **Automatic Updates**: The app periodically checks feeds for new posts and displays them instantly.
- **Read/Unread Tracking**: New posts are displayed in bold. Once you view a post, itâ€™s marked as read.
- **Modal Post Previews**: View a summary of each post in a modal window, with a link to the full article.
